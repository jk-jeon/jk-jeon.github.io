This post revisits the topic of integer division, building upon the discussion in [the previous post](https://jk-jeon.github.io/posts/2023/08/optimal-bounds-integer-division/). Specifically, I'll delve into determining the number of trailing zeros in the decimal representation of an input integer, or more broadly, identifying the highest power of a given constant that divides the input. This exploration stems from the problem of converting floating-point numbers into strings, where certain contemporary algorithms, such as [Schubfach](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1luHhyQF9zKlM8yJ1nebU0OgVYhfC6CBN/edit) and [Dragonbox](https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox), may yield outputs containing trailing zeros.

Let us stat the precise statement of our problem:

> Given positive integer constants $n_{\max}$ and $q\leq n_{\max}$, how to find the largest integer $k$ such that $q^{k}$ divides $n$, together with the corresponding $\frac{n}{q^{k}}$, for any $n=1,\ \cdots\ ,n_{\max}$?

As one can expect, this more or less boils down to an efficient divisibility test algorithm. However, merely testing for divisibility is not enough, and we need to actually divide the input by the divisor when we know the input is indeed divisible.

# Na√Øve algorithm

Some of the readers may wonder, isn't this an extremely simple problem? Why not just do, something like:

```cpp
std::size_t s = 0;
while (true) {
    auto const r = n % q;
    if (r == 0) {
        n /= q;
        s += 1;
    }
    else {
        break;
    }
}
return {n, s};
```

Of course, this works (as long as $n\neq 0$ which we do assume throughout), but obviously our objective is to explore avenues for greater performance. Thus, let us see what is the main performance issue I want to tackle in the above. Here, we are assuming that the divisor $q$ is a given constant, so any sane modern compiler knows that the dreaded generic integer divison is not necessary. Rather, they would replace the division into a multiply-and-shift, or some slight variation of it, as explained in [the previous post](https://jk-jeon.github.io/posts/2023/08/optimal-bounds-integer-division/). That is great, but note that we need to compute *both* the quotient and the remainder. As far as I know, there is no k known algorithm capable of computing both quotient and remainder with *only one* multiplication, which means that the above code will perform *two* multiplications per iteration. However, if we consider cases where the input is not divisible by the divisor, we realize that we don't actually require the precise values of the quotient or the remainder. Our sole concern is whether the remainder is *zero*, and *only if* that is the case, we do want to know the quotient of the division. Therefore, it's conceivable that we could accomplish this with just one multiplication per iteration.

Actually, [the classical paper](https://gmplib.org/~tege/divcnst-pldi94.pdf) by Granlund-Montgomery already positively answered this question, which is the topic of the next section.

# Granlund-Montgomery modular inverse algorithm

First, let us assume that $q$ is an odd number for a while. Assume further that our input is of $b$-bit unsigned integer type, e.g. of type `std::uint32_t`, with $b=32$. Hence, we are assuming that $n_{\max}$ is at most $2^{b}-1$. Now, since $q$ is *coprime* to $2^{b}$, there uniquely exists the *modular inverse* of $q$ with respect to $2^{b}$. Let us call it $m$, which in general can be found using the extended Euclid's algorithm. But how is it useful to us?

The key observation here is that, on the ring $\mathbb{Z}/2^{b}$ of integer residue classes modulo $2^{b}$, the multiplication by any integer coprime to $2^{b}$ is an automorphism, i.e., a *bijective* group homomorphism onto itself. In particular, multiplication by such an integer induces a *bijection* from the set $\{0,1,\ \cdots\ ,2^{b}-1\}$ onto itself.

Now, what does this bijection, defined in particular by the modular inverse $m$ (which must be coprime to $2^{b}$), do to multiples of $q$, i.e., $0, q,\ \cdots\ ,\left\lfloor\frac{2^{b} - 1}{q}\right\rfloor q$? Note that for any integer $a$,

$$
  (aq)m \equiv a(qm) \equiv a\ (\operatorname{mod}\ 2^{b}),
$$

thus, the bijection $\{0,1,\ \cdots\ ,2^{b}-1\}\to\{0,1,\ \cdots\ ,2^{b}-1\}$ defined by $m$ maps $aq$ into $a$. Therefore, *anything that gets mapped into $0,1,\ \cdots\ ,\left\lfloor\frac{2^{b}-1}{q}\right\rfloor$ must be a multiple of $q$*, because the map is a bijection, and *vice versa*.

Furthermore, the image of this bijection, in the case when the input $n$ was actually a multiple of $q$, is precisely $n/q$. Since multiplication modulo $2^{b}$ is what C/C++ abstract machines are supposed to do whenever they see an integer multiplication, we find that the following code does the job we want, but with *only one* multiplication per an iteration:

```cpp
// m and threshold_value are precalculated from q.
// m is the modular inverse of q, and
// threshold_value is (0xff....ff / q) + 1.
std::size_t s = 0;
while (true) {
    auto const r = n * m;
    if (r < threshold_value) {
        n = r;
        s += 1;
    }
    else {
        break;
    }
}
return {n, s};
```

All is good so far, but recall that this works *only when $q$ is odd*. Unfortunately, our main application, the trailing zero removal, requires $q$ to be $10$, which is even.

Actually, [the paper](https://gmplib.org/~tege/divcnst-pldi94.pdf) by Granlund-Montgomery proposes a clever solution for the case of possibly non-odd divisors, based on *bit-rotation*. Let us write $q = 2^{t}q_{0}$ for an integer $t$ and a positive odd number $q_{0}$. Obviously, there is no modular inverse of $q$ with respect to $2^{b}$, but we can do the next best thing, that is, to find the modular inverse of $q_{0}$ with respect to $2^{b-t}$. Let us call it $m$.

Now, for given $n=0,1,\ \cdots\ ,n_{\max} \leq 2^{b}-1$, let us consider the multiplication $nm$ modulo $2^{b}$ and then perform bit-rotate-to-right on it by $t$-bits. Let us call the result $r$. Clearly, the highest $t$-bits of $r$ is all-zero if and only if the lowest $t$-bits of $(nm\ \operatorname{mod}\ 2^{b})$ is all-zero, and since $m$ must be an odd number, this is the case if and only if the lowest $t$-bits of $n$ is all-zero, that is, $n$ is a multiple of $2^{t}$.

We claim that $n$ is a multiple of $q$ if and only if $r \leq \left\lfloor\frac{2^{b}-1}{q}\right\rfloor = \left\lfloor\frac{2^{b-t}-1}{q_{0}}\right\rfloor$ holds. By the argument from the previous paragraph, $r$ must be strictly larger than $\left\lfloor\frac{2^{b-t}-1}{q_{0}}\right\rfloor$ if $n$ is not a multiple of $2^{t}$, since $\left\lfloor\frac{2^{b-t}-1}{q_{0}}\right\rfloor$ is at most of $(b-t)$-bits. Thus, we only need to care about the case when $n$ is a multiple of $2^{t}$. In that case, write $n=2^{t}n_{0}$, then $r$ is in fact equal to

$$
  \frac{(nm\ \operatorname{mod}\ 2^{b})}{2^{t}}
  = \frac{nm - \lfloor nm/2^{b}\rfloor 2^{b}}{2^{t}}
  = n_{0}m - \left\lfloor \frac{n_{0}m}{2^{b-t}}\right\rfloor 2^{b-t}
  = (n_{0}m\ \operatorname{mod}\ 2^{b-t}),
$$

since the lowest $t$-bits of $(nm\ \operatorname{mod}\ 2^{b})$ are all zero. By the discussion of the case when $q$ is odd, we know that $n_{0}$ is a multiple of $q_{0}$ if and only if $(n_{0}m\ \operatorname{mod}\ 2^{b-t})$ is at most $\left\lfloor\frac{2^{b-t}-1}{q_{0}}\right\rfloor$, thus finishing the proof of the claim.

Of course, when $n$ was really a multiple of $q$, the resulting $r$ is precisely $n/q$, by the same reason as in the case of odd $q$. Consequently, we obtain the following version which works for all $q$:

```cpp
// t, m and threshold_value are precalculated from q.
// t is the number of trailing zero bits of q,
// m is the modular inverse of (q >> t) with respect to 2^(b-t), and
// threshold_value is (0xff....ff / q) + 1.
std::size_t s = 0;
while (true) {
    auto const r = std::rotr(n * m, t); // C++20 <bit>
    if (r < threshold_value) {
        n = r;
        s += 1;
    }
    else {
        break;
    }
}
return {n, s};
```

# Lemire's algorithm

In a [paper published in 2019](https://doi.org/10.1002/spe.2689), Lemire et al proposed an alternative way of checking divisibility which has some advantages over Granlund-Montgomery algorithm. The theorem behind this algorithm was not optimal when first presented, and later they showed the optimal result in [another paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07442). Here, I present a more general result which contains the result by Lemire et al as a special case. This is one of the theorems I proved in my [paper on Dragonbox](https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox/tree/master/other_files/Dragonbox.pdf) (Theorem 4.6), which I copied below:

The theorem above shows a necessary and sufficient condition for the product $nx$ to be an integer in terms of a good enough approximation $\xi$ of $x$. The second item is irrelevant in this post, so we only focus on the first item. The point here is that we are going to let $x = \frac{1}{q}$ so that $nx$ is an integer if and only if $n$ is a multiple of $q$. In that case, it is shown in the [paper](https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox/tree/master/other_files/Dragonbox.pdf) (*Remark 2* after Theorem 4.6) that we can always take $\xi = \eta$ as long as $\xi$ satisfies the condition

$$\label{eq:precondition}
  \left\lfloor \frac{n}{q} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor n\xi \right\rfloor
$$

for all $n=1,\ \cdots\ ,n_{\max}$, so that $n$ is a multiple of $q$ if and only if

$$
  n\xi - \left\lfloor n\xi \right\rfloor < \xi.
$$

Also, another theorem from [the paper](https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox/tree/master/other_files/Dragonbox.pdf) (Theorem 4.2) shows that a necessary and sufficient condition for having the above is that

$$
  \frac{1}{q} \leq \xi < \frac{1}{q} + \frac{1}{vq}
$$

holds, where $v$ is the greatest integer with $v\equiv -1\ (\operatorname{mod}\ q)$ and $v\leq n_{\max}$, i.e.,

$$
  v=\left\lfloor \frac{n_{\max} + 1}{q} \right\rfloor q - 1.
$$

In practice, we take $\xi = \frac{m}{2^{b}}$ for some positive integers $m,b$ so that

$$
  n\xi - \lfloor n\xi\rfloor < \xi
$$

holds if and only if

$$
  (nm\ \operatorname{mod}\ 2^{b}) < m.
$$

Hence, the above is a necessary and sufficient condition for $n$ to be divisible by $q$, as long as the inequality

$$
  \frac{1}{q} \leq \frac{m}{2^{b}} < \frac{1}{q} + \frac{1}{vq}
  = \frac{\left\lfloor (n_{\max}+1)/q\right\rfloor}
  {\left\lfloor (n_{\max}+1)/q\right\rfloor q - 1}
$$

holds. Furthermore, since $\left\lfloor nx\right\rfloor = \left\lfloor n\xi \right\rfloor$ holds, the quotient $\left\lfloor \frac{n}{q}\right\rfloor$ can be also computed as

$$
  \lfloor n\xi\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{nm}{2^{b}} \right\rfloor.
$$

In other words, we multiply $m$ to $n$, then the lowest $b$-bits can be used for inspecting divisibility, while the remaining upper bits constitutes the quotient.

Note that this is always the case, regardless of whether $n$ is divisible by $q$ or not, so this algorithm actually does more than what we are asking for. Furthermore, there is only *one* magic number, $m$, while Granlund-Montgomery requires two. However, one should also note that the cost of these "extra features" is that we must perform a "widening multiplication", that is, if $n_{\max}$ and $m$ are of $b$-bits, then we need all of $2b$-bits of the multiplication of $n$ and $m$. It is also worth mentioning that the magic number $m$ might actually require more than $b$-bits. For details, please refer to [the previous post]((https://jk-jeon.github.io/posts/2023/08/optimal-bounds-integer-division/)), or [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07442) by Lemire et al.

In any case, the algorithm we obtain work like the following:

```cpp
// m is precalculated from q.
std::size_t s = 0;
while (true) {
    auto const r = widening_mul(n, m);
    if (low_bits(r) < m) {
        n = high_bits(r);
        s += 1;
    }
    else {
        break;
    }
}
return {n, s};
```

# Generalized modular inverse algorithm

Staring at [**Theorem 1**](#integer-check), one can ask: *if all we care about is **divisibility**, not the quotient, then do we really need to take $x = \frac{1}{q}$?* That is, as long as $p$ is any integer coprime to $q$, asking if $n/q$ is an integer is exactly the same question as asking if $\frac{np}{q}$ is an integer. In fact, this observation leads to a derivation of the modular inverse divisibility check algorithm by Granlund-Montgomery explained [above](#granlund-montgomery-modular-inverse-algorithm) for the case of odd divisor, and the Dragonbox paper already did this (*Remark 3* after Theorem 4.6). A few days ago, I realized the same argument actually applies to the case of general divisor as well, which leads to yet another divisibility check algorithm explained below, which I think probably is novel.

Suppose that $p$ is a positive integer coprime to $q$, then as pointed out, $n$ is divisible by $q$ if and only if $nx$ is an integer with $x\coloneqq\frac{p}{q}$. Therefore, by [**Theorem 1**](#integer-check) (together with Theorem 4.2 from [the Dragonbox paper](https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox/tree/master/other_files/Dragonbox.pdf)), for any $\xi,\eta$ satisfying

$$\label{eq:condition for xi}
  \frac{p}{q} \leq \xi < \frac{p}{q} + \frac{1}{vq}
$$

and

$$\label{eq:condition for eta}
  \left\lfloor \frac{n_{\max}}{q} \right\rfloor q\left(\xi - \frac{p}{q}\right)
  < \eta \leq u\left(\xi - \frac{p}{q}\right) + \frac{1}{q},
$$

a given $n=1,\ \cdots\ ,n_{\max}$ is divisible by $q$ if and only if

$$\label{eq:integer check condition}
  n\xi - \left\lfloor n\xi \right\rfloor < \eta,
$$

where $v$ is the greatest integer satisfying $vp\equiv -1\ (\operatorname{mod}\ q)$ and $u$ is the smallest positive integer satisfying $up\equiv 1\ (\operatorname{mod}\ q)$.

Again, since our goal is to make the evalation of the inequality $\eqref{eq:integer check condition}$ as easy as possible, we may want to take $\xi=\frac{m}{2^{b}}$ and $\eta=\frac{s}{2^{b}}$ as before, so that $\eqref{eq:integer check condition}$ becomes

$$
  (nm\ \operatorname{mod}\ 2^{b}) < s.
$$

Although that is what we will do eventually, let us consider a little bit more general case that $\xi=\frac{m}{N}$ and $\eta=\frac{s}{N}$ for any positive integer $N$, not necessarily of the form $2^{b}$, for the sake of ~~pedantry~~ clarity of what is going on. Of course, in this case $\eqref{eq:integer check condition}$ is equivalent to

$$
  (nm\ \operatorname{mod}\ N) < s.
$$

With this setting, we can also rewrite $\eqref{eq:condition for xi}$ and $\eqref{eq:condition for eta}$ as

$$\label{eq:condition for xi modified}
  0 \leq qm - Np < \frac{N}{v}
$$

and

$$\label{eq:condition for eta modified}
  \left\lfloor \frac{n_{\max}}{q} \right\rfloor \left(qm - Np\right)
  < s \leq \frac{u}{q}\left(qm - Np\right) + \frac{N}{q},
$$

respectively. Note that, both sides of the above inequality have the factor $qm - Np$, and the left-hand side multiplies it to $\left\lfloor\frac{n_{\max}}{q}\right\rfloor$ and the right-hand side multiplies it to $\frac{u}{q}$. Since $u$ is at most $q-1$, usually $\left\lfloor\frac{n_{\max}}{q}\right\rfloor$ is much larger than $\frac{u}{q}$, so it is usually the case that the inequality can hold only when the factor $qm - Np$ is small enough. So, it makes sense to actually *minimize* it. Note that we are to take $N = 2^{b}$ and $b$ is a factor defined by the application, while $m$ and $p$ are something we can choose. In such a situation, the smallest possible nonnegative value of $qm - Np$ is exactly $g\coloneqq \operatorname{gcd}(q,N)$, the greatest common divisor of $q$ and $N$. Recall that a general solution for the equation $qm - Np = g$ is given as

$$
  m = m_{0} + \frac{Nk}{g},\quad
  p = p_{0} + \frac{qk}{g}
$$

where $m_{0}$ is the modular inverse of $\frac{q}{g}$ with respect to $\frac{N}{g}$, $p_{0}$ is the unique integer satisfying $qm_{0} - Np_{0} = g$, and $k$ is any integer.

Now, we cannot just take any $k\in\mathbb{Z}$, because this whole argument breaks down if $p$ and $q$ are not coprime. In particular, $p_{0}$ is not guaranteed to be coprime to $q$. For example, take $N=32$ and $q=30$, then we get $g=2$, $m_{0}=15$ and $p_{0}=14$ so that $qm_{0} - Np_{0} = 2$, but $\operatorname{gcd}(p_{0},q) = 2$. Nevertheless, it is always possible to find some $k$ such that $p = p_{0} + \frac{qk}{g}$ is coprime to $q$. The proof I wrote below of this fact is due to [Seung uk Jang](https://seungukj.github.io/):

><b id="coprime-existence">Proposition 2</b>
>Let $a,b$ be any integers and $g\coloneqq\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)$. Then there exist integers $x,y$ such that $ax - by = g$ and $\operatorname{gcd}(a,y) = 1$. Specifically, such $x,y$ can be found as

>$$
>
>we know that $y_{0}$ is coprime to $\frac{a}{g}$, thus $y$ is coprime to $\frac{a}{g}$. This means that $y$ is coprime to $a$. Indeed, let $p$ be any prime factor of $a$, then $p$ should divide either $\frac{a}{g}$ or $g$. If $p$ divides $\frac{a}{g}$, then it cannot divide $y$ since $y$ is coprime to $\frac{a}{g}$. Also, if $p$ divides $g$ but not $\frac{a}{g}$, then it divides $g/\operatorname{gcd}(a/g,g)$ which is again coprime to $y$. $\quad\blacksquare$

For instance, applying this proposition to our example $N=32$, $q=30$ yields

$$
  m = 15 + 16k,\quad p = 14 + 15k
$$

with $k$ being the smallest positive integer satisfying

$$
  15k \equiv 1 - 14\ (\operatorname{mod}\ 2),
$$

which is $k=1$. Hence, we take $m = 31$ and $p = 29$.

In fact, for the specific case of $N=2^{b}$ and $q\leq N$, we can always take either $k=0$ or $1$. Indeed, by the assumption $g$ is a power of $2$ and $q/g$ is an odd number. Then, exactly one of $p_{0}$ and $p_{0} + \frac{q}{g}$ is an odd number, so exacty one of them is coprime to $g$. On the other hand, since

$$
  \left(\frac{q}{g}\right)m_{0} - \left(\frac{N}{g}\right)p_{0} = 1,
$$

we know $p_{0}$ is coprime to $\frac{q}{g}$, so both $p_{0}$ and $p_{0} + \frac{q}{g}$ are coprime to $\frac{q}{g}$. Therefore, the odd one between $p_{0}$ and $p_{0}+\frac{q}{g}$ must be coprime to $q$.

In any case, let us assume from now on that we have chosen $m$ and $p$ in a way that $\operatorname{gcd}(p,q) = 1$ and $qm - Np = g$. Then $\eqref{eq:condition for xi modified}$ and $\eqref{eq:condition for eta modified}$ can be rewritten as

$$
  v < \frac{N}{g}
$$

and

$$
  \left\lfloor \frac{n_{\max}}{q} \right\rfloor g
  < s \leq \frac{ug + N}{q},
$$

respectively. Next, we claim that $\frac{ug+N}{q}$ is an integer. Indeed, we have

$$
  (ug+N)p \equiv g + Np \equiv qm \equiv 0
  \ (\operatorname{mod}\ q),
$$

and since $p$ is coprime to $q$, $ug+N$ must be a multiple of $q$. Hence, the most sensible choice of $s$ in this case is $s = \frac{ug+N}{q}$, and let us assume that from now on. Then, the left-hand side of the inequality above can be rewritten as

$$
  \left\lfloor\frac{n_{\max}}{q}\right\rfloor q - u < \frac{N}{g}.
$$

Actually, this inequality follows from $v < \frac{N}{g}$, so is redundant, because $v$ can be written in terms of $u$ as

$$
  v = \left\lfloor \frac{n_{\max} + u}{q}\right\rfloor q - u.
$$

Plugging in the above equation into $v<N/g$, we obtain that the only condition we need to ensure is

$$
  \left\lfloor\frac{n_{\max} + u}{q}\right\rfloor < \frac{(N/g) + u}{q},
$$

or equivalently,

$$\label{eq:nmax condition}
  n_{\max} \leq \left\lfloor \frac{(N/g)+u}{q}\right\rfloor q + q - 1 - u.
$$

Therefore, as long as the above is true, we can check divisibility of $n=1,\ \cdots\ ,n_{\max}$ by inspecting the inequality

$$
  (nm\ \operatorname{mod}\ N) < \frac{ug+N}{q}.
$$

Furthermore, if $n$ turned out to be a multiple of $q$, then we can compute $n/q$ from $(nm\ \operatorname{mod}\ N)$ as in the classical Granlund-Montgomery case. More precisely, assume that $n=aq$ for some integer $a$, then

$$\begin{align*}
  (nm\ \operatorname{mod}\ N)
  &= aqm - \left\lfloor \frac{aqm}{N}\right\rfloor N
  = aqm - \left(\left\lfloor \frac{a(qm - Np)}{N}\right\rfloor + ap\right)N \\
  &= a(qm - Np) - \left\lfloor \frac{ag}{N}\right\rfloor
  = ag - \left\lfloor \frac{ag}{N}\right\rfloor.
\end{align*}$$

We show that $ag < N$ always holds as long as $1<q<N$, $aq \leq n_{\max}$ hold and $n_{\max}$ satisfies $\eqref{eq:nmax condition}$. Indeed, $ag < N$ is equivalent to $aq < \frac{qN}{g}$, so it is enough to show the right-hand side of $\eqref{eq:nmax condition}$ is strictly less than $\frac{qN}{g}$. Note that

$$\begin{align*}
  \left\lfloor \frac{(N/g)+u}{q} \right\rfloor q + q-1-u
  &\leq \frac{(N/g)+u}{q} \cdot q + q - 1 - u \\
  &= \frac{N}{g} + q - 1,
\end{align*}$$

and

$$
  \frac{qN}{g} - \left(\frac{N}{g} + q - 1\right)
  = \left(\frac{N}{g} - 1\right)\left(q - 1\right) > 0
$$

by the condition $1<q<N$. Therefore, in this case we always have

$$
  (nm\ \operatorname{mod}\ N) = ag,
$$

thus $a$ can be recovered by computing $\frac{(nm\ \operatorname{mod}\ N)}{g}$. Note that in particular if $N=2^{b}$, division by $g$ is just a bit-shift.

Compared to the method proposed by Granlund-Montgomery, bit-rotation is never needed, but at the expense of requires an additional shift for computing $n/q$. Note that this shifting is only needed if $n$ turned out to be a multiple of $q$. The divisibility check can be done with one multiplication and one comparison.

This sounds like this new new method is better than the Granlund-Montgomery one, but note that the maximum possible value of $n_{\max}$ (i.e., the right-hand side of $\eqref{eq:nmax condition}$) is roughly of the size $N/g$, so in particular, if $N=2^{b}$ and $q = 2^{t}q_{0}$ for some odd integer $q_{0}$, then $n_{\max}$ can be at most of about $(b-t)$-bits. Since $u$ is determined from $p$, the maximum possible value of $n_{\max}$ depends on the choice of $p$, and some choice of $p$ may result in a larger value than some other choices, but at this moment I do not know of an elegant way of choosing $p$ that maximizes it.

In summary, the algorithm works as follows, assuming $N=2^{b}$.

1. Write $q = 2^{t}q_{0}$ for an odd integer $q_{0}$.
2. Let $m_{0}$ be the modular inverse of $q_{0}$ with respect to $2^{b-t}$, and let $p_{0}\coloneqq (q_{0}m_{0}-1)/2^{b-t}$.
3. If $p_{0}$ is odd, let $p\coloneqq p_{0}$, otherwise, let $p\coloneqq p_{0} + q_{0}$.
4. Let $m\coloneqq (2^{b-t}p + 1)/q_{0}$.
5. Let $u$ be the modular inverse of $p$ with respect to $q$.
6. Then for any $n=0,1,\ \cdots\ ,\left\lfloor (2^{b-t}+u)/q\right\rfloor q + q - 1 - u$, $n$ is a multiple of $q$ if and only if

$$
  (nm\ \operatorname{mod}\ 2^{b}) < \frac{2^{b-t}+u}{q_{0}}.
$$

7. In case the above inequality holds, we also have

$$
  \frac{n}{q} = \frac{(nm\ \operatorname{mod}\ 2^{b})}{2^{t}}.
$$

The corresponding code for factoring out the highest power of $q$ would look like the following:

```cpp
// m, threshold_value and t are precalculated from q.
std::size_t s = 0;
while (true) {
    auto const r = n * m;
    if (r < threshold_value) {
        n = r >> t;
        s += 1;
    }
    else {
        break;
    }
}
return {n, s};
```

One should keep in mind that the above only works provided $n$ is at most $\left\lfloor (2^{b-t}+u)/q\right\rfloor q + q - 1 - u$, which is roughly equal to $2^{b-t}$.

# Benchmark

Which one will perform the best, obviously, would depend on the myriads of details. Nevertheless, I ran a benchmark to have some idea on relative performances between these algorithms. Since my intended application was for trailing zero removal, the divisor $q$ is $10$ in this benchmark. Also, in Dragonbox, trailing zero removal may be needed only for numbers of at most $8$ digits for IEEE-754 binary32, and for numbers of at most $16$ digits for IEEE-754 binary64, so I made these assumptions for finding out the magic numbers of each algorithm.

Here is the data I got on my laptop (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz, Windows 10):

And here are some detailed information on how the benchmark is done:
- Samples are randomly generated by the following procedure:
  - Uniformly randomly generate the number of total digits, from 1 to the prescribed maximum number of digits.
  - Given the number of total digits, uniformly randomly generate the number of trailing zeros, from 0 to the number of total digits minus 1.
  - Given the number of total digits and the number of trailing zeros, uniformly randomly generate an unsigned integer.
- "Generalized Granlund-Montgomery" means the generalized modular inverse algorithm explained in the [last section](#generalized-modular-inverse-algorithm).
- Algorithms without any suffix remove trailing zeros one by one. These are the code shown in the previous sections.
- Algorithms with "2-1" suffix first remove as must two consecutive trailing zeros as possible (i.e., run the loop with $q=100$), and then remove one more zero if needed.
- Algorithms with "8-2-1" suffix first try to see if the input has at least eight trailing zeros (using the corresponding divisibility check algorithm with $q=10^{8}$), and if that is the case, then remove eight zeros and call the 32-bit "2-1" variants of themselves. If there are less than eight trailing zeros, then they proceed as their "2-1" variants.

It seems there is not so much difference between all three algorithms overall, and even the na√Øve one is not so bad. The data shown above seems to indiciate that generalized Granlund-Montgomery is the fastest, but when I ran the benchmark several times the data fluctuated quite a bit and the best performer changed run by run. All three consistently performed better than the na√Øve one though.

My conclusion is that, I would just use the generalized Granlund-Montgomery algorithm, since it does not require any special operations, like bit-rotation as in the classical Granlund-Montgomery or widening multiplication as in Lemire, and it can be done with only standard C/C++ arithmetic operations. Of course, the downside is that it has smaller range of valid input. If that causes a trouble, then I would fallback to the classical Granlund-Montgomery. Lemire's algorithm is still very useful if I have to know the quotient regardless of divisibility. There indeed is such an occasion in Dragonbox, and I am already using Lemire's algorithm for that.
