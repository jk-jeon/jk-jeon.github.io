Point-free measure theory is an approach to measure theory in a more abstract viewpoint. Specifically, it forgets the notion of "points" and tries to recover the whole measure theory only with the notion of measurable sets. We will briefly see why this viewpoint has a potential to liberate us from the agony that we feel all the time when an uncountable collection pops up in measure theory. We will also talk about how to define "measurable functions" in the point-free way.
