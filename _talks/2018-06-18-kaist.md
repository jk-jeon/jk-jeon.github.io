In this talk, we introduce some basics of Gelfand theory and show that every commutative unital $C^{*}$-algebra can be viewed as the algebra of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space. And we briefly discuss how this theory can be utilized to show a spectral theorem for bounded normal operators.
