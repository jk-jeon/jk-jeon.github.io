I am a graduate student of the Department of Mathematics in the University of California San Diego, under the advisement of Prof. [Andrej Zlato≈°](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~zlatos/). My CV is available [here](http://jk-jeon.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

Academic interests
======
I am mainly working on fluid dynamics, currently on singularity formation problem for incompressible Euler equation, generalized SQG equations and related problems. I also have broad interests in mathematics, especially in PDE, differential geometry, functional analysis and measure theory (maybe also algebra and number theory to some extent).

Hobbies
======
* Besides math, I enjoy reading things from physics, computer science and electrical engineering for fun.
* Programming is another thing that I do for fun, with C++ as my primary language. I developed a fast floating-point-to-string conversion algorithm which I call [Dragonbox](https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox).
* Music and musical instruments are also things I'm very enthusiastic about. I was a member of a [school band](https://www.facebook.com/KAISTCJDH/) when I was an undergrad, and I used to play many instruments such as guitar, piano and drums. I also occasionally write songs.
